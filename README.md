<b> SENTINEL OS <b><br>

SentinelOS is a Debian-native, security-focused OS that prioritizes integrity and transparency: documented threat model, cryptographic trust boundaries, supply-chain policy, and reproducible build specifications.
<br><br>
This repo includes the live-build tooling, release packaging, and the Security Handbook.
The “policy-as-packages” posture model (inspired by declarative system principles) is specified here; policy package sources will be maintained in a separate repo.
